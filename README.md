The program built is a reservation system for a cafe, which requires signing up
The program gives several links for cancelling and going on the previous page, as well as "Don't have a profie?" option, which directly transfers you from the login to the sign up page
It has user friendly messages showing somewhat the exact problem
Each textbox has automatic labels (ex. Username, Email, Password) which go back to default id the user hasn't typed anything
When logged in, it welcomes the user with the given username
On the last page I've set the first row as default for better error handling
The show all button shows all the available and unavailable tables
The check button shows the exact table the user seacrches for, but it's not required
The reserve button actively changes from available to unavailable in real time, so it doesn't make mistakes
